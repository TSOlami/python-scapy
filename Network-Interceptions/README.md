# Network interception

Network interception is the process of capturing network traffic and inspecting it closely to determine what is happening on the network. There are Two Monitoring Techniques Router Based and Non-Router Based. Monitoring functionalities that are built-into the routers themselves and do not require additional installation of hardware or software are referred to as Router Based techniques. Non-Router based techniques require additional hardware and software to be installed and provide greater flexibility. Router Based Monitoring Techniques are hard-coded into the routers and therefore offer little flexibility. Non-router based techniques are still limited in their abilities they do offer more flexibility than the router based techniques.
